Static wiki generator using. Under Development.


* Assumptions

- You are using a flat file wiki system (all content files in a single directory)
- The wiki-dir has a =media= folder of some kind, also at the same leve.
- You are using =file:= links in org to add images.
- Many other things I am probably forgetting right now.
