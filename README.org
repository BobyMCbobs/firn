ðŸš§ Static site generator using org-mode. Under Development. Not recommended for use.

* What's this?

Firn generates a website from your .org mode files. It's original intention was
to support the building of a flat file wiki (but can handle nested folders.)

Currently, running the program on a directory of org files performs the
following:

- Reads all .org files in the directory recursively
- Load up layouts and partials and read these templates from hiccup files.
- Iterates over files and runs them through [[https://github.com/PoiScript/orgize][Orgize]], then turns the resulting
  data into html.
  
* Usage

No out-of-the-box usage yet. You're going to need emacs and a repl.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar <path_to_code>/firn/target/uberjar/firn-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar <path_to_content>
#+END_SRC


* Assumptions / Limitations
- the content _directory name_ (ex: "my_wiki") should not exist anywhere else in
  the path to a file in the wiki.
  - for example, this is bad: /development/*my_wiki*/some_more_dirs/*my_wiki*/file_1.org
  - Unlikely that user's will have this, but it's currently a limitation nonetheless.
- Org mode links should be set to relative. You can probably do this with
  dir-locals and setting [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32601/how-can-i-get-with-org-store-link-relative-path-instead-of-absolute][org-link-file-path-type]] to =relative=.
