#+TITLE: Adjacent Files
#+FIRN_UNDER: Content "The Render Function"

*Purpose:* This document explains how to render links to "adjacent files" based on the ~#+FIRN_ORDER~ frontmatter.

*Prerequistes*: an understanding of [[file:the-render-function.org][The Render Function]], [[file:layout.org][layouts]].

* Overview

In some cases, you may wish to indicate what the "next" and "previous" page may be on your Firn site - /adjacent files/ accomplish this.


Constructing "adjacent files" will only work if you are using the "Firn Order" keyword:

#+BEGIN_SRC
#+TITLE: My File
#+FIRN_ORDER: 3
#+END_SRC

When rendering ~My File~, the adjacent-files render function will look for the next biggest integer found in a #+FIRN_ORDER of a document

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
; render a list of the previous and next file.
; this determines the Next/Previous file based on FIRN_ORDER
(render :adjacent-files)

; Renders Next/Previous file based on date created.
(render :adjacent-files {:sort-by :date})

; Changes the html output for "previous" and "next" text:
(render :adjacent-files {:next-text "Newer post: "
                         :prev-text "Older post: "})
#+END_SRC
