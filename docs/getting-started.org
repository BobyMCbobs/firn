- [[file:clojure.org][Clojure resources]] - Resources for Clojure, which Firn uses to build [[file:layout.org][layouts]].
- [[file:setup.org][Editor Setup]] - Notes on setting up your environment (ie, mostly Emacs) to best work with Firn
- [[file:firn-differences.org][Differences from other Static Site Generators]]
