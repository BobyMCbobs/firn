* Overview
Firn is able to tag files using the front matter ~#+FIRN_TAGS~ or ~#+ROAM_TAGS~. Firn tags are for categorizing information on a file to file basis. Please note this is different from using org-mode tags (referred to as "org-tags" throughout this documentation.)

* Usage

Firn's file tagging functionality is partially based on how Org Roam [[https://www.orgroam.com/manual/Tags.html#Tags][handles tagging]]. Tag values are space delimited. Multi-word tags must be wrapped in quotations marks.

Example: ~#+FIRN_TAGS: "Programming Languages" Research Development~

Firn automatically reads in the ~ROAM_TAGS~ front matter, allowing you to make use of whatever tags you might already have if you are an org-roam user. If you have both ~FIRN_TAGS~ and ~ROAM_TAGS~ in your front-matter, ~FIRN_TAGS~ will be given precedence for providing the tag values for a file when building your site.
